# Classroom-Attentiveness-Monitoring-System

EduGauge is a real-time computer vision system that detects student attentiveness and drowsiness using facial landmarks, deep learning, and rule-based analytics.
The project demonstrates end-to-end ML application development, from model integration to a browser-based frontend.

🔹 Designed as a portfolio-ready AI project for education, proctoring, and engagement analysis.

A. Key Highlights (Recruiter View)-

Built a real-time attention monitoring system using MediaPipe + YOLOv8

Implemented hybrid detection logic (rule-based + ML fallback)

Designed robust drowsiness detection using EAR, mouth ratio, and head tilt

Integrated backend ML inference with frontend visualization

Followed industry-standard Git & project structuring practices
